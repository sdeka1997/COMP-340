    "## Collaborative Filtering by Matrix Factorization\n",
    "In collaborative filtering we wish to factorize our ratings matrix into two smaller feature matrices whose product is equal to the original ratings matrix. Specifically, given some partially filled ratings matrix $X\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$, we want to find feature matrices $U \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times k}$ and $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times k}$ such that $UV^T = X$. In the case of movie recommendation, each row of $U$ could be features corresponding to a user, and each row of $V$ could be features corresponding to a movie, and so $u_i^Tv_j$ is the predicted rating of user $i$ on movie $j$. This forms the basis of our hypothesis function for collaborative filtering: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_\\theta(i,j) = u_i^T v_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, $X$ is only partially filled (and usually quite sparse), so we can indicate the non-presence of a rating with a 0. Notationally, let $S$ be the set of $(i,j)$ such that $X_{i,j} \\neq 0$, so $S$ is the set of all pairs for which we have a rating. The loss used for collaborative filtering is squared loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ell(h_\\theta(i,j),X_{i,j}) = (h_\\theta(i,j) - X_{i,j})^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The last ingredient to collaborative filtering is to impose an $l_2$ weight penalty on the parameters, so our total loss is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i,j\\in S}\\ell(h_\\theta(i,j),X_{i,j}) + \\lambda_u ||U||_2^2 + \\lambda_v ||V||_2^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, we'll let $\\lambda_u = \\lambda_v = \\lambda$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## MovieLens rating dataset\n",
    "To start off, let's get the MovieLens dataset. This dataset is actually quite large (24+ million ratings), but we will instead use their smaller subset of 100k ratings. You can go  fetch this from their website, or download from Canvas. \n",
    "\n",
    "* You can download the archive containing their latest dataset release from http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small.zip (last updated October 2018). \n",
    "* For more details (contents and structure of archive), you can read the README at http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-README.html\n",
    "* You can find general information from their website description located at http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, we will only be looking at the ratings data specifically. However, it is good to note that there is additional data available (i.e. movie data and user made tags for movies) which could be used to improve the ability of the recommendation system. "

    "## Matrix factorization\n",
    "We are going to consider a slightly different approach to collaborative filtering, which fits better into the machine learning frameworks we have discussed so far. For the user-user and item-item approaches, we didn’t find the notion of a hypothesis function, loss function, and optimization procedure, since there was really no training phase of the algorithm to speak of (the methods can be viewed in this way, with the weighting functions corresponding to different losses, but it’s not particularly intuitive). But with matrix factorization, the correspondence is much more direct, so we’ll use this notation here. The presentation here is somewhat brief.\n",
    "The core idea of the matrix factorization approach to collaborative filtering is that we’re going to approximate the $X$ matrix as a product of two lower-rank matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{X} \\approx U V, U \\in \\Re^{m\\times k}, V \\in \\Re^{k\\times n} $$ \n",
    "where $k≪m,n$. In the collaborative filtering setting we only look to approximate the matrix on terms that are observed in $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s define this a bit more formally in terms of the specific elements rows and columns of the matrices $U$ and $V$ respectively. For each user $i=1,\\ldots,m$ we define a set of user-specific weights, $u_i \\in \\Re^k$; and for each item $j=1,\\ldots, n$ we define a set of item-specific weights, $v_j \\in \\Re^k$. Our prediction $\\hat{X}_{ij}$ (which we’ll more formally denote as our hypothesis function now), is simply given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{X}_{ij} = h_{\\theta}(i,j)= u_i^T  v_j $$\n",
    "where here our parameters are just all the $u$ and $v$ vectors, $\\theta=\\{u_{1:m},v_{1:n}\\}$. You can also think of $u_i$ and $v_j$ as being something that is both like a feature vector and a parameter vector. For a given user $i$, our hypothesis function is a linear hypothesis with parameters $u_i$, and we make our predictions by taking the inner product with these parameters and the item “features” $v_j$. Thus, the goal of matrix factorization is to simultaneously learn both the per-user coefficients and the per-item features.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the performance of a given set of parameters, we’ll use the squared loss function,\n",

    "## Alternating least squares\n",
    "Finally, how do we solve this optimization problem? There are actually a number of ways of doing so (including traditional gradient descent), but a common method in practice here is to use a technique called alternating least squares. The method is common enough that it’s worth explaining in a bit of detail. The basic idea here is that it’s difficult to solve the optimization problem globally over both $u$ and $v$ (in fact this is a non-convex problem, so there is the possibility of local optima). \n",

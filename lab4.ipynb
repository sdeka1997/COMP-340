Notice above that while Yelp told us that there are ~14900, the response contained far fewer actual `Business` objects. This is due to pagination and is a safeguard against returning __TOO__ much data in a single request (what would happen if there were 100,000 restaurants?) and can be used in conjuction with _rate limiting_ as well as a way to throttle and protect access to Yelp data.\n",

Just like the Python functions you have been writing have arguments (or parameters) that allow you to customize its behavior/actions (an output) without having to rewrite the function entirely, we can parameterize the queries we make to the Yelp API to filter the results it returns."

    "Think of APIs as similar to accessing a application's database itself (something you can interactively query and receive structured data back). But the results are usually in a somewhat raw form with no formatting or visual representation (like the results from a database query). This is a benefit _AND_ a drawback depending on the end use case. For data science and _programatic_ analysis this raw form is quite ideal, but for an end user requesting information from a _graphical interface_ (like a web browser) this is very far from ideal since it takes some cognitive overhead to interpret the raw information. And vice versa, if we have HTML it is quite easy for a human to visually interpret it, but to try to perform some type of programmatic analysis we first need to parse the HTML into a more structured form.\n",

    "> As a general rule of thumb, if the data you need can be accessed or retrieved in a structured form (either from a bulk download or API) prefer that first. But if the data you want (and need) is not as in our case we need to resort to alternative (messier) means.\n",
